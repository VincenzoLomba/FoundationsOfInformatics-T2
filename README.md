# Foundation of Informatics T2

This repository contains all the code developed during lessions of [Foundation of Informatics T2](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/434698),
which is a teaching of [Computer Engeneering's degree](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerEngineering) ([Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage)).<br/>
<br/>
All the code is written in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/it/java/). All projects and exercises are developed using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).<br/>

## <p>Project Lombok <img vertical-align="text-bottom" src="https://projectlombok.org/favicon.ico"></img></p>
  
[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) is a really useful and powerful tool (and it's also used in this repository's code).<br/>
It introduces a lot of features which make the code way more cleaner and readable.<br/>
The annotation [@Getter](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter) is a cool example. [Check all its features out!](https://projectlombok.org/features/all)
